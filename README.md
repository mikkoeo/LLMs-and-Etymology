# LLMs-and-Etymology
Experimentation with a Large Language Model (LLM) - specifically Davinci-003 - reveals that enriching a prompt with the history of the formation (etymology) of key terms improves recall and answer quality.
My testable hypothesis is that such improvements are transferable to human brains and that the mechanism involved in improved prediction is based on the pattern generated by selection pressures (histories) that led to key words’ eventual meaning. I would argue that the causation, and the underlying components of a word’s meaning offer additional intrinsic correlation power.
